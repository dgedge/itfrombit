Roadmap to Gauge Interactions and the Lamb Shift
"While this paper establishes the free 1+1D wave equations (Dirac and Schrödinger) via the $I_3$ CNOT oscillation, the natural extension is the inclusion of $U(1)$ gauge interactions and bound states. In the circlette lattice, gauge bosons are hypothesized to be propagating phase-offsets—signals that synchronize the CNOT clock parity across neighboring cells to maintain global constraint validity. By modeling virtual photons as localized computational phase-slips, and vacuum polarization as the physical interaction between propagating codewords and the 102 single-error vacuum states, the framework possesses all required ingredients to derive the Lamb shift. Crucially, because the lattice imposes a strict UV cutoff at the Planck scale (one update per Planck time), such calculations will take the form of finite combinatorial sums over lattice paths, entirely bypassing the divergent integrals and mathematical artifacts of standard QFT renormalization."
