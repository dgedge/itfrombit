# The Place of the Circlette Framework in the Realist Quantum Tradition

**Date:** February 2026

**Author:** David Elliman

**Subject:** On the compatibility of the Circlette Framework with Bell’s Theorem and its relationship to the Bohmian Pilot Wave.

### 1. Introduction: A Return to Realism

The "Circlette Framework" proposes that the fundamental fermions of the Standard Model are error-correcting codewords on a 2D holographic lattice. This model sits firmly within the **Realist Quantum Tradition** (Einstein, de Broglie, Bohm, 't Hooft). Unlike the Copenhagen interpretation, which treats the unobserved world as fundamentally probabilistic and abstract, this framework posits a definite, deterministic, and objective reality at the Planck scale.

A common objection to such realist theories is that they are ruled out by Bell’s Theorem. This note clarifies why the Circlette Framework evades this criticism and how it provides the physical mechanism for David Bohm’s "Pilot Wave."

### 2. Evading Bell’s Theorem: Holographic Non-Locality

Bell’s Theorem disqualifies "Local Hidden Variable" theories, where particles carry instruction sets through 3D space. The Circlette Framework avoids this prohibition by rejecting the assumption of **3D Locality**.

- **Emergent Space:** In this model, 3D spacetime is not fundamental; it is the error-corrected logical output of a 2D surface.
- **The Shared Address:** Two entangled particles separated by light-years in the emergent 3D bulk are, on the fundamental 2D lattice, merely two "pointers" accessing the same memory address. There is no signal traveling faster than light through space; there is simply a single informational constraint being resolved simultaneously at two logical locations.
- **Conclusion:** The framework is **non-local in 3D** because it is **local in 2D**. Bell’s inequalities are not violated; they are simply inapplicable to the fundamental substrate of reality. This aligns with the "Cellular Automaton" interpretation of 't Hooft , where the apparent randomness of measurement is the result of coarse-graining a deterministic underlying computation.

### 3. Fisher Information as the Pilot Wave

David Bohm proposed that a particle is guided by a "Quantum Potential" ($Q$) - a wave encoding information about the environment. The Circlette Framework identifies the physical origin of this potential.

- **Lattice Distortion:** Gravity and force fields are described as the curvature of the **Fisher Information Metric** on the lattice. This curvature represents the density of information processing required at each point.
- **Active Information:** Bohm described the pilot wave as "active information" guiding the particle. In this framework, that guidance is literal: the particle follows the path of **Minimum Information Action**. It moves not because of mechanical force, but to minimize the bit-flip cost of its existence on the lattice.
- **Correspondence:** The "Lattice Distortion" is the Pilot Wave. The Fisher Metric provides the "hidden order" that dictates the particle’s trajectory, vindicating Bohm’s intuition that particles have definite paths determined by a field of information.

### 4. The Implicate and Explicate Orders

The framework provides a concrete mathematical realisation of Bohm’s philosophical structure:

* **The Implicate Order:** This is the **2D Holographic Lattice**. It is the enfolded, non-local, deterministic substrate where the "calculation" of the universe occurs.
* **The Explicate Order:** This is our **3D Spacetime**. It is the unfolded projection - the display screen, where the results of the computation manifest as particles, distance, and time.

### 5. Conclusion

The Circlette Framework does not require "spooky action at a distance" or "hidden variables" moving through space. Instead, it proposes that the universe is a **deterministic computation on a holographic surface**. This resolves the tension between quantum mechanics and realism by showing that the "weirdness" of the quantum world is simply the artifact of viewing a non-local, 2D data structure through a local 3D lens. It satisfies the realist demand for an objective physical mechanism while fully reproducing the non-local statistics of quantum mechanics.
