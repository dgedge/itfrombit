What if the universe is a typo?

Every proton in your body is a single-bit error in an error-correcting
code — a pattern that almost satisfies the rules but breaks one. The
code tries to fix it, but can't: the logic gate that runs the weak
force literally lacks the instruction to perform the repair. That
limitation is why protons are stable. It is why atoms exist. It is
why you are holding this book.

Living in the Matrix proposes that the Standard Model of particle
physics — all 45 fundamental fermions, three generations, three
forces — emerges from four parity-check rules applied to an 8-bit
codeword on an octagonal ring. One logic gate. One lattice. One code.

From these ingredients, the model derives charged lepton masses to
0.007% accuracy, the weak mixing angle to 0.3%, and the W/Z mass
ratio to 0.06%. It predicts that neutrinos are their own
antiparticles, that proton decay proceeds by quantum tunnelling
through a topological barrier, and that every conservation law in
physics is one equation: the XOR sum is zero.

Book One builds the alphabet — encoding, dynamics, mass, gravity,
and cosmology. Book Two builds the grammar — composites, beta decay,
the W-boson as XOR differential, and molecular geometry from the
tiling of oriented rings.

Every prediction is quantitative. Every prediction is falsifiable.
Several are testable by experiments now running.

"The lattice does not obey quantum mechanics.
 Quantum mechanics obeys the lattice."
